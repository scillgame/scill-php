# EventPayload

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**user_id** | **string** | This is your user id. You can set this to whatever you like, either your real user id or an obfuscated user id. However you need to be consistent here. Events linked to this user id only track if challenges or battle passes are unlocked with the same user id. | 
**session_id** | **string** | This is required if event_type is single and identifies a session. This can be anything used to group events together. For example this can be a level or a match id. | 
**event_name** | **string** | This is the event type as a string. These have predefined event names for many games and applications. Itâ€™s wise to use those as this allows us to analyse data and help you balancing your application or game. | 
**event_type** | **string** | This is either single or group. You can send multiple events in one request (group) or send events in sequence. Please note, that depending on your tier you might run into rate limits. | [optional] [default to 'single']
**meta_data** | **object** | This holds metadata and is optional. However, you can use this to send additional info, like a weapon in a kill event. This way you can build more elaborate challenges like Kill 10 enemies with AK47 and with no armor protection. | [optional]
